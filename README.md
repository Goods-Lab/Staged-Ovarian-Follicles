# Transcriptomic Analysis of Early Ovarian Folliculogenesis  
This repository contains the data processing and analysis pipeline for our study on the transcriptional signatures of early ovarian follicle development. We used single-follicle RNA-sequencing to identify key pathways involved in follicle activation and growth.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – Processed datasets (metadata and raw count matrices)
- `code/` – Code for preprocessing, differential expression analysis, and visualization
- `figures/` – Output figures used in the manuscript
- `README.md` – Project documentation
